In 2 hours window I've completed all the tasks aparat from task 5 (reduce the number of API calls being made by using a cache).
If I had more time, I would definetely do a couple more adjustments to the app:

✍️ Add more form validation, so user couldn't input anything but htwe outcode and the app provided some tooltips
✍️ Edit the CSS file, make the app appearance more neat and change the width of the cards

## Thank you for viewing my technical test assigment!
